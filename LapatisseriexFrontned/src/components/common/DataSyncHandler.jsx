/**
 * DataSyncHandler - DEPRECATED AND REMOVED
 * 
 * Previously handled manual synchronization between Redux and localStorage.
 * Now completely removed since:
 * 1. redux-persist handles all state persistence automatically  
 * 2. Store subscription manages localStorage sync for Firebase compatibility
 * 3. Root reducer keeps auth and user slices synchronized bidirectionally
 * 4. No manual localStorage writes needed anymore
 * 
 * This component is now a no-op and can be safely removed from imports.
