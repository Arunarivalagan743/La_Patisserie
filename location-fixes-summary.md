# Location Feature Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes made to address the location selection issues in the application.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Profile Component Location Dropdown**
   - Fixed the location dropdown in the Profile component to properly display and select the user's current location
   - Added default location selection when user has no location yet
   - Added debugging information to help track selected location IDs

2. **Real-time Location Updates in Header**
   - Modified `LocationContext.updateUserLocation()` to update the local user state immediately after backend update
   - Exposed the `setUser` function from AuthContext to allow other contexts to update user data
   - Added debugging logs to verify location updates are working
