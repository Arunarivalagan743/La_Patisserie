# Email Notification Setup Guide

## Overview
This system sends automated email notifications to users when:
1. **Order Confirmation** - When a new order is placed
2. **Status Updates** - When admin updates order status (confirmed, preparing, ready, out_for_delivery, delivered)

## Email Templates
Beautiful, responsive HTML email templates with:
- Order progress visualization
- Professional branding
- Mobile-friendly design
- Order details and tracking links

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-gmail-app-password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### 2. Gmail App Password Setup
1. Go to [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to "App Passwords" section
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this app password (not your regular password) for EMAIL_PASS

### 3. Alternative Email Providers
You can use other SMTP providers by modifying `utils/orderEmailService.js`:

```javascript
// For Outlook/Hotmail
service: 'hotmail'

// For Yahoo
service: 'yahoo'

// For custom SMTP
host: 'smtp.yourprovider.com',
port: 587,
secure: false,
```
